WHAT IS GITTIP?

Gittip is a way to give small weekly cash gifts to people you love and are
inspired by.
Gifts are weekly. The intention is for people to depend on money received
through Gittip in order to pay their bills, and bills are recurring.
Gifts come with no strings attached. You don't know exactly where your gifts
come from, and the maximum gift from one person to another is $100 per week.
Gifts are public. The total amount you give and the total amount you receive is
public. Participants on both sides of the equation are rewarded publicly for
their participation. (You can opt out of publicly displaying your total giving.)
